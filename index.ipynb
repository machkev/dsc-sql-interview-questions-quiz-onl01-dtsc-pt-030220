    "# SQL Interview Questions  - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "INTEGER\n",
    "TEXT\n",
    "REAL\n",
    "BLOB\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, we can use other common types from other kinds of SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Key is the unique identifier (column) in each table. A foreign key is the column that connects one table with another table where they also appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "The different types of relationships includes a JOIN (joining one table with another), it includes one-to-many joins and many-to-many joins, that is joining one table to several tables or joining several tables to several other tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Left Join\n",
    "Rigt Join\n",
    "Inner Join\n",
    "Full Join\n",
    "Outer Join\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Aggregate function is a function where the values of multiple rows are grouped together to form a single summary value. For example, average, sum, count, max,etc.\n",
    "The GROUP BY Statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows. It is often used with Aggregate functions to group the result-set by one or more columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "An Associative Entity is the table that associates two other tables in a many-to-many relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we practiced answering open-ended interview questions for SQL and Relational Databases. "
